Making the binary
"make" will generate the binary "pitchcatch"

Usage
pitchcatch -t number_of_ball_types

From our experience 
1 or 2 types problems are easy, "pitchcatch -t 1"
3 or 4 types problems are medium, "pitchcatch -t 3"
5 or more types problems are hard, "pitchcatch -t 5"

Examples
We provide 5 easy problems, easy*, 5 medium problems, medium* 
and 5 hard problems, hard*.
These can easily be generated with "pitchcatch -t n" commands.
