Making the binary
"make" will generate the binary "schedule"

Usage
schedule -c number-of-classes -u maximum-timeline-for-a-packet -l average-plan-length

From our experience 
1 or 2 class problems are easy, e.g. "schedule -c 1 -u 5 -l 30"
3 or 4 class problems are medium, "schedule -c 3 -u 5 -l 1000"
5 or more class problems are hard, "schedule -c 5 -u 10 -l 2000"

Examples
We provide 5 easy problems, easy*, 5 medium problems, medium* 
and 5 hard problems, hard*.
These can easily be generated with "schedule -c n -u un" commands.
